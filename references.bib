  abstract = {ABSTRACTEcosystems provide various goods and services (provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting) that benefit humans both directly and indirectly. Soil plays an important role in ecosystem services therefore soil analyses can provide quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate ecosystem goods and services. Soil analyses must be integrated with the frameworks for ecosystem services and existing organizational hierarchy of soil systems to provide missing links to scale, time, degree of computation and complexity. This case study demonstrates the importance of evaluating soil organic carbon (SOC) within this newly proposed context using glaciated soils at the Cornell University Willsboro Research Farm in upstate New York as the example. The vertical distribu tion of SOC was analyzed quantitatively by soil depth class (topsoil versus subsoil), soil order, and other relevant variables that relate to the organizational hierarchy of soil systems.}

  abstract = {Abstract Soil health research has developed soil tests to validate management strategies for creating healthier soils, such as cover crops, compost, and reduced tillage.~ Missing in this research agenda are soil health management strategies and diagnostics tailored~to the systematic variation of~soils.~ The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database offers comprehensive estimates for many properties linked to soil health indicators. This research employs unsupervised classification of soil surface (0-30 cm) properties and root restrictive horizons in an internationally important agricultural region, the Central and Coastal Valleys of California, covering 5.6 million hectares of mostly cropland.~~K-means clustering of ten soil properties derived from SSURGO revealed groups distinct from USDA-NRCS Soil Taxonomy.~ Clustering metrics, data visualization, and validation tests justified a seven-region soil health conceptual model that divided the landscape into two broad classes, those with and without performance limitations.~ Results revealed three pedogenic conditions limiting soil performance: (1) root restrictive horizons that impede root growth into deeper soil (2) salinity and alkalinity harmful to crops; and (3) shrink-swell properties making soils challenging to cultivate.~ Soils without performance limitations, soils with restrictive horizons, and salt-affected soils are further divided by texture and/or organic matter for a total of seven soil health regions.~ In reality, variation in soil properties is often continuous across the landscape and sometimes fractal in nature, but this research establishes a testable framework for evaluating soil health diagnostics according to geographically coherent differences in soil properties, demonstrating potential for how soil health management and interpretation can be tailor-made to the landscape.

  abstract = {Erosion rates and annual soil loss tolerance (T) values in evaluations of soil management practices have served as focal points for soil quality (SQ) research and assessment programs for decades. Our objective is to enhance and extend current soil assessment efforts by presenting a framework for assessing the impact of soil management practices on soil function. The tool consists of three steps: indicator selection, indicator interpretation, and integration into an index. The tool's framework design allows researchers to continually update and refine the interpretations for many soils, climates, and land use practices. The tool was demonstrated using data from case studies in Georgia, Iowa, California, and the Pacific Northwest (WA, ID, OR). Using an expert system of decision rules as an indicator selection step successfully identified indicators for the minimum data set (IVIDS) in the case study data sets. In the indicator interpretation step, observed indicator data were transformed into unitless scores based on site-specific algorithmic relationships to soil function. The scored data resulted in scientifically defensible and statistically different treatment means in the four case studies. The efficacy of the indicator interpretation step was evaluated with stepwise regressions using scored and observed indicators as independent variables and endpoint data as iterative dependent variables. Scored indicators usually had coefficients of determination (R\^sup 2\^) that were similar or greater than those of the observed indicator values. In some cases, the R\^sup 2\^ values for indicators and endpoint regressions were higher when examined for individual treatments rather than the entire data set. This study demonstrates significant progress toward development of a SQ assessment framework for adaptive soil resource management or monitoring that is transferable to a variety of climates, soil types, and soil management systems.
